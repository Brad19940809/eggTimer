- This app is built by following the tutorial: [link](#https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000011319297)

## summary
> First of all, Using Xcode to build app, no matter for iOS or MacOS, the first basic knowledge is the 
Swift language. without the understanding of Swift, it is difficult to continue building of app.
The best tutorial for Swift is the official document, [link](#https://docs.swift.org), and here is a Chinese translation version[link](#https://swiftgg.gitbook.io/)

> Then, after creating the app using one of the three interfaces for MacOS app, which is called Storyboard, you need to
know how it works. Firstly, open the file under the project directory called `main.storyboard`, you can see the visable interface, including three parts: Application Scene, Window Controller Scene and View Controller Scene. From the left side of the Editor, the whole structure of  storyboard is shown clearly.
- `Storyboard Entry point` is the first window you see after starting the App. 
- From Library you can add `window controller`  to storyboard.
- Hold `control` key and drag menu item to window controller to activate the binding action. 
- Hold `control` key and drag element to `viewController.swift` file to connect the element and variable. Then you can program using these connections.

> Next, here comes the `Assets.xcassets`.  Many images are imported. Nevertheless, not only images, but other things. You can go further to expore more.

> A good design of an application is to catogorize the files.
And then distinguish the pattern. For instance, in this app, the design pattern is called MVC, one of the most common patterns in the world. By the way, main.storyboard is the `View`. 

> To learn how the codes are arranged and written, is a inspiring thing. Before building your owned App, it is a good way to learn how the other people write the code, especially the invoke of functions and extensions, the place the function should be put.
